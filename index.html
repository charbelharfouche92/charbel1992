		Capstone (Design) is the first part of your major project assessment which is extended over 2 semesters in our final year.
		It focuses on designing and developing a proposal for your major project, giving you a foundation that you will take into the 
		second semester to help you finish you major project. 
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Assessment 1: Student supervisor agreement is just an agreement that you and your supervisor sign on with how you will approach your major project.</li>
			<li>Assessment 2: Poster confrence presentation is creating a poster about your major project to be presented infront of teachers and industry leaders.</li> 
			<li>Assessment 3: Literature review and capstone project plan is a report of what has been researched before and the plan you will take.</li>

	<div class="bar"><h2>Advanced imaging technology (AGT)</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you have done yourself-->
	<div class="paragraphs">
		Advanced imagine technology invovled a few practicals and a few tests/exam that were interesting and involved a range of different technologies and programs.
		<p>
		Last year, we compeleted 3 practicals in AIT that involved the use of LIDAR. All 3 practicals where from different types of observations one from a photo from an iPhone,
		another was from the use of a terrestial and mobile laser scanner and the last one being and aerial image. The assessment names are mentioned below:
		<ul>
			<li>Photogrammetry practical: 3D Photogrammetry reconstruction of Melbourne Gaol</li>
			<li>LiDAR practical 1: 3D reconstruction of Melbourne Gaol using terrestial and mobile laser scanner</li>
			<li>LiDAR practical 2: visualisation Aerial LiDAR data and creating surface models</li>
			
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The reconstruction of Melbourne goal was creating using Agisoft Metashape Pro and MATLAB and also required the use of our own personal phones along with a measuring
			tape that was at least 10m. The second practical involved information that was retreived from multiple scanners which were used to scan the melbourne gaol facade
			the main program used for this assessment was cloudcompare. The last practical was looking over an aerial image and creating surface models from it. This required
			the use of ArcGIS Pro with "spatial analysis" and "ImageAnalyst". Below are photos that show the completed models of what was created.
